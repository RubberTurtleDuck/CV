        I began my journey as a programmer a few weeks back by enrolling in Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete
        Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022.
        <br>It's a thrilling experience. Every day I learn a new lesson, and I use what I learned to develop a daily
        personal project. I've learned so much and coded so many projects; a Caesar cypher, a Snake game, a web app to
        find the cheapest flight deals using APIs, and the list goes on.
        <br>I spend most of my free time learning and coding, researching exciting projects to develop, solving coding
        challenges and bugs, and I can't get enough of it. I actually built this website myself with the knowledge I got
        from the extra HTML and CSS lessons in the course' program.
        <br>It feels like there's always a puzzle waiting to be solved. And I looooove puzzles.
